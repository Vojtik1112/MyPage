## üöÄ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vojtik1112/MyPage.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the webpage.
3. **For the Contact Form**: The form uses Formspree by default. You need to create a Formspree account, create a new form, and replace `"YOUR_FORMSPREE_ID"` in `index.html` with your actual Formspree form ID endpoint. Alternatively, adapt the form action to point to your own backend service.
4. Modify the files as needed to customize the webpage content (texts, project details, resume link, etc.).
